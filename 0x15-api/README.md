<h2>What is an API ?</h2>
<p>
An API is the interface that a software program presents to others programs, to humans, and, in the case of web APIs, to the world via the internet. An API's design belies much about the program behind itâ€”business model, product, features, the occasional bug. Although API's are designed to work with other programs, they're mostly intended to be understood and used by humans writing those other programs.
